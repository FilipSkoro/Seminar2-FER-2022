Automatic definition of a matrix model of a railway system based on network data

In todayâ€™s time of great globalization and urbanization of society, certain branches of transport often encounter problems in the control of vehicles.
One such branch of transport is rail transport. In order to avoid possible collisions on split lines and potential collisions, it is necessary to qualitatively
regulate the situation on the railway network. This paper presents the solution of control and regulation of railway networks using a matrix model of the system.
The paper describes the problem and explains the way in which the system is described by matrices, then how the system is represented by a Petri net and then
the program implementation of this method is explained. At the end, the advantages and disadvantages of describing the system with a matrix model are concluded.
